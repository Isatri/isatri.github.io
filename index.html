							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>Born in the smog-ridden city of Houston, Isaiah's childhood dream of studying the stars seemed worlds away. However, after many trials and tribulations, he was able to enroll in Rice University and pursue a degree in Astrophysics. He currently works with Dr. Andrea Isella studying the origin of asymmetries in protoplanetary disks.</p>

							<h2>Stellar Interactions with Protoplanetary Disks</h2>
							<p>
								My <strong>undergraduate senior thesis</strong> at <strong>Rice University</strong> revolved around determining if the asymmetries in protoplanetary disks we see in nature are caused by gravitational interactions with neighboring stars. The Gaia DR2, which was convieniently released after my graduation, is now being used to complete the project.

							<h2>Searching for Host Stars of Free-Floating Planetary Mass Objects</h2>
							<p>This on-going project was started during my time in the <strong>TAURUS REU</strong> program at <strong>The University of Texas at Austin</strong>. The general idea is to catalog the currently known rogue exoplanets and find potential wide-binary host stars using proper motions.</p>

							<h2>Creating and Sustaining a Cloud in a Chamber</h2>
							<p>Ever wonder what clouds do when you're not looking? During my time in the <strong>Atmospheric Science REU</strong> program at <strong>Texas A&M University</strong>, I helped in researching the in-cloud production of aqueous secondary organic aerosols. Try saying that one three times fast!</p>

							<h2>Class Projects</h2>

							<dl>
								<dt>Galactic Merger Simulations</dt>
								<p>For my final project in Computational Physics, I modeled galaxy mergers. Many simplfications were made in order to run the program on a laptop, and the code produced animations of two simple galaxies colliding. <a href="webpages/galaxymerge.html">Read more...</a></p>
								
								<dt>Solar Sodium Lines</dt>
								<p>One assignment in my Astrophysics I: Sun and Stars class was to develop a code which calculates the number densities for important electron donor elements (neutral and first ionization) in a model solar atmosphere. It was later expanded to compute the line profile of the Na I D line at 5890 angstroms. <a href="#reference-spotlight">More soon...</a></p>
								
								<dt>Determining the Composition of Jupiter's Atmosphere</dt>
								<p>This project was completed for my sophomore Astronomy Lab. The webpage was coded in HTML/CSS and presented as part of the final. <a href="webpages/astr230.html">Read more...</a></p>

							<h2>Other Work</h2>

							<dl>
								<dt>Rice Splash</dt>
								<p>Rice Splash is a program where underpriveledged middle-schools from around Houston bring their students to attend a few classes taught by students at Rice. The classes contain material that would usually be overlooked or unexplored within a normal cirriculum. The classes I taught were all Astronomy-based with an emphasis on planets. <a href="webpages/ricesplash.html">Read more...</a></p>

								<dt>Teaching</dt>
								<p>I was a teaching assistant for the ASTR 201 course at Rice University for multiple semesters. The work included tutoring and holding weekly office hours, but I also developed a few tools along the way, which I supply here. <a href="webpages/teaching.html">Read more...</a></p>

								<dt>Planet Exoplanet - Exoplanetary Science News Bot</dt>
								<p>I created and run a subreddit where a bot finds articles about planets, exoplanets, and related planetary science topics and posts them called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlanetExoplanet">Planet Exoplanet</a>. 
								<br />
								I've also created a small guide on the process of making a Reddit bot. <a href="webpages/redditbot.html">See how a Reddit bot is made...</a></p>

								<dt>Non-Scientific Writing</dt>
								<p>Aside from research, I occasionally write things. <a href="webpages/writing.html">Read more...</a></p>
