							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>Born in the smog-ridden city of Houston, Isaiah's lifelong dream of studying the stars seemed worlds away. However, after many trials and tribulations, he was able ot enroll in Rice University to persue a degree in Astrophysics. He currently works with Dr. Andrea Isella in studying the origin of asymmetries in protoplanetary disks.</p>

							<h2>Origins of Asymmetries in Protoplanetary Disks</h2>
							<p>This project was started for and used as my senior thesis at <strong>Rice University</strong>. The basic motivation is determining if asymmetries in protoplanetary disks could be caused by gravitational interactions with neighboring stars.</p>

							<h2>Finding Host Stars for Free-Floating Planetary Mass Objects</h2>
							<p>This project was started during my time in the <strong>TAURUS</strong> program at <strong>The University of Texas at Austin</strong>. The basic motivation behind the project is to take the currently known rouge exoplanets and find potential wide-binary host stars using proper motion data.</p>

							<h2>Class Projects</h2>

							<dl>
								<dt>Galactic Merger Simulations</dt>
								<p>For my final project in Computational Physics, I modeled galaxy mergers. Many simplfications were made in order to run the program on a laptop, and the code produced animations of two simple galaxies colliding. <a href="webpages/galaxymerge.html">Read more...</a></p>
								
								<dt>Solar Sodium Lines</dt>
								<p>One assignment in my Astrophysics I: Sun and Stars class was to develop a code which calculates the number densities for important electron donor elements (neutral and first ionization) in a model solar atmosphere. It was later expanded to compute the line profile of the Na I D line at 5890 angstroms. <a href="#reference-spotlight">More soon...</a></p>
								
								<dt>Determining the Composition of Jupiter's Atmosphere</dt>
								<p>This project was completed for my sophomore Astronomy Lab. The webpage was coded in HTML/CSS and presented as part of the final. <a href="webpages/astr230.html">Read more...</a></p>

							<h2>Other Work</h2>

							<dl>
								<dt>Rice Splash</dt>
								<p>Rice Splash is a program where underpriveledged middle-schools from around Houston bring their students to attend a few classes taught by students at Rice. The classes contain material that would usually be overlooked or unexplored within a normal cirriculum. The classes I taught were all Astronomy-based with an emphasis on planets. <a href="webpages/ricesplash.html">Read more...</a></p>

								<dt>Teaching</dt>
								<p>I have been a teaching assistant for the ASTR 201 course at Rice University for multiple semesters. This work included tutoring and holding weekly office hours. <a href="webpages/teaching.html">Read more...</a></p>

								<dt>Non-Scientific Writing</dt>
								<p>Aside from research, I occasionally write things. <a href="https://www.r2ricereview.com/blog/march-monthly-contest-winner">Read more...</a></p>
