							<h1>Galaxy Mergers</h1>
							<p>Modeling galaxy collisions with Python</p>
						</header>


						<p>
							In only four billion years, our galaxy, The Milky Way, will collide and combine with its nearest neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy. While we will be long gone and the Sun of its last leg, we still have reason to wonder how exactly galaxies behave during collisions and what consequences follow.

							The most accurate and complicated galaxy merger models are computed using supercomputers with plenty of running time. I had neither a supercomupter nor plenty of time to complete this project, so a few <strong>simplifications</strong> had to be made:

							<ul>
								<li>No star-to-star interactions</li>
								<li>No direct collisions</li>
								<li>The central super-massive black hole has approximately the same mass as the Milky Way's</li>
								<li>No gas clouds or star formation</li>
								<li>No halo or bulge in the galaxy</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

  							<br />
						</p>


						<p>
							Using a conservation-of-energy analysis, I found that the majority of the simulation conserved energy, with there being small errors when the two black holes interact too closely. This could be solved by using a smaller timestep when computing collisions, but would require more time to run.
							<br /> <br />
							Despite all the simplifications made and the small blip in energy conservation, the simulation appears reasonable, as some of the structures resulting from random collisions are seen in what we believe to be galaxy collisions in nature.
