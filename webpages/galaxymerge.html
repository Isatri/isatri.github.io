							<h1>Galaxy Mergers</h1>
							<p>Modeling galaxy collisions with Python</p>
						</header>


						<p>
							In only four billion years, our galaxy, The Milky Way, will collide and combine with its nearest neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy. While we as a species will be long gone, there is reason to wonder how galaxies behave during collisions and what rippling consequences follow.
						</p>

						<h2>Making Galaxies Collide</h2>

						<p>
							The basic concept was to create two galaxies near each other and have them smack into each other. The basic concept for a galaxy was to create a collection of stars spinning around a black hole, which was done through object oriented programming in Python.

  						<p>
							The most accurate and complicated galaxy merger models are computed using supercomputers with plenty of running time. I had neither a supercomputer nor plenty of time to complete this project, so a few <strong>simplifications</strong> had to be made:

							<ul>
								<li>No star-to-star interactions</li>
								<li>No direct collisions</li>
								<li>The central super-massive black hole has approximately the same mass as the Milky Way's</li>
								<li>No gas clouds or star formation</li>
								<li>No halo or bulge in the galaxy</li>
							</ul>
						</p>

  							<br />
						</p>

						<h2>Checks and Balances</h2>
						<p>
							Using a conservation-of-energy analysis, I found that the majority of the simulation conserved energy, with there being small errors when the two black holes interact too closely. This could be solved by using a smaller timestep when computing collisions, but would require more time to run.
							<br /> <br />
							Despite all the simplifications made and the small blip in energy conservation, the simulation appears reasonable, as some of the structures resulting from random collisions are seen in what we believe to be galaxy collisions in nature.

						<h2>Peer Reviews</h2>
						<p>
							At the end of my Computational Physics course, I gave a presentation on this project. This great task earned me peer feedback like "Object oriented", "Had simplifications", "Voice very monotone", "Spoke clearly and with enthusiasm", and "This was the best project in my opinion. Good work!"
