							<h1>Rice Splash</h1>
							<p>Teaching classes about planets</p>
						</header>

						<p>I taught classes for the 2017 and 2018 Rice Splash programs. The Splash program brings children from low-income schools around Houston to attend classes geared towards them while encouraging them to consider college as an option for their future.</p>

							My first class was titled "<em>Exoplanets: Worlds Beyond Our Solar System</em>". During the class, I taught about how stars form, how planets form during star formation, and about the different types of exoplanets, mainly focusing on examples and oddities. After the short lecture, we created a theoretical exoplanet together as a class. This included deciding on a name, whether it would be a rocky or gassy planet, how come it would be to its star, and discussing what each of these would imply for the planet. Afterwards, each student would create a planet of their own and write a short story to it. This exercise was meant to combine science and writing and to encourage thinking creatively about science.

							The second class I taught was titled "<em>Out of this World: Stars and Planets</em>". The lecture to begin class was much the same as the first class, although a little more time was spent detailing how stars and planets formed together. Then, students were divided into teams, with each creating their own planet. Once they had a solid idea and were able to go over some of the science behind their creation, the groups were given modeling clay in order for them to make models of their planet. Finally, the class would bring their planets together and plan out their class solar system.

							Should anyone be interested, I've uploaded my lesson plans for "<em><a href="../images/lessons/class1.pdf">Exoplanets: Worlds Beyond Our Solar System</a></em>" and "<em><a href="../images/lessons/class2.pdf">Out of this World: Stars and Planets</a></em>" which can be found by clicking the titles.
							Each plan contains the types of classes that would benefit most from them and tips for certin portions given my expeirences teaching them. Take these with a grain of salt depending on your experiences with your own classes and students.

							Updated slides used for the classes coming soon.
